\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}
This report is the result of a project to implement a simple 2D-platformer game engine for the Game Engines, E2013 course at IT-University of Copenhagen.

The required features of the engine were:
\begin{my_itemize}
\item Side scrolling
\item 2D platformer physics (walking, jumping, falling)
\item Collision detection (eg. between player and enemy)
\item Sprite animations based on state (walking vs standing)
\item Architecture based on game loop and events
\end{my_itemize}

In addition to the required features of the engine, I have implemented animation of walking for the player and enemies.

My implementation supports a game consisting of a single level. The y-position of the camera is fixed, so while the engine supports "tall" levels, the camera will not show the player or anything outside the "standard" level height.
\\The engine supports 1 texture for "solid" game tiles, 1 goal tile and up to 6 different types of enemies (two example enemies are included).

The game engine is implemented in C++ for Windows using the SDL 2.0 framework\footnote{http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php - SDL\_image and SDL\_ttf libraries were also used.}

I have worked with Jacob Grooss (jcgr@itu.dk) on parts of this project (mainly the design, but also parts of the implementation).
